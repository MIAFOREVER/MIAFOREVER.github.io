      <p class="paragraph-41">In the year of 1839, 79 people from the upper class died, with an average deceased age of 44 years old. Number of deaths of those bourgeois, in contrast, was 824, ten times of the upper class, and the average deceased age was only 27. The working class, possessed a strikingly death number of 3,395, over 40 times of the gentry; however, the average age of deceased was only 19, equivalent to the age of a university freshman. Right now, things are much progress, with one in three people in Leeds are 50 years old or over. The average expectant age reaches 80 years old.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-43">When it comes to the death rate, this line graph shows the crude death rates in Leeds from 1865-1905, with an average death rate of 23.075‰. At the same time, it shows a decreasing trend, indicating an improvement in quality of life. Until 2021, the death rate in Leeds has dropped to 9.2‰.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-47">The sewerage system has also been progressing. Since the pipes were installed, an increase in daily water consumption can be seen, from an average of 7,255,000 litres in 30,996 houses in 1856 to 20,034,000 litres in 46,305 houses in 1865. Let’s do the math. The average daily water consumption of these years is 12,936,333 litres, and the average Leeds population in 1850s and 60s was approximately 277,388. So we can draw a conclusion that the daily water consumption per head is 47 litres per capita during that time. While at present, a person in the UK uses approximately 145 litres per day. That’s a huge progress!</p>
